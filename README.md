# PygameSpaceShooter

This is a simple "game" in python using pygame.

I am not a game programmer and this is one of my first games and probably the furthest I have ever gotten. 

At the moment there are only a few resources available as the original resources used were purchased and the license does not allow for distribution. Hopefully I can create/aquire resources that I can make public.

The original resources were named "SpaceShooter Part 1" by Pixel-Boy of https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/superpowers fame.
