# PygameSpaceShooter

This is a simple "game" in python using pygame.
At the moment there are only a few resources available as the resources used were purchased and the license would not be public. Hopefully I can create/aquire resources that I can make public.

I am not a game programmer and this is one of my first games and probably the furthest I have ever gotten.
